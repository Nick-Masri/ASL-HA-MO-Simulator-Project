# ASL-HA-MO-Simulator-Project

This project is a simulator for the HA:MOD systems.
In this project, we utilize two different types of controllers:
- The Naive Controller: The status quo
- The Smart Controller: The challenger

By creating this simulator, we hope to gauge the effectiveness of the two controllers.
